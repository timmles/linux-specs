# TODOs and Considerations
# - This probably doesn't pull all the values you need.
#   But these underlying commands are extensive and have a lot of info - take a look at what else they provide
#   I've tried to comment each command so you can see what the underlying command is and how we awk those results to get what we need.
#   I've tried to keep the awk as simple as possible and use the underlying command to manipulate the output (e.g. "lsblk -n" removes the headers
#
# - This was only tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine. These commands may not be available in your distro

# dmidecode is used for dumpign system info in a human readable format
# dmidecode has an overview, set of data listed under specific types
# however to prevent having to grep or awk that data, they have keywords availble for specific sets of data

# using dmidecode special keyword for system system product name
make_model=$(sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name)

# using dmidecode special keyword for system serial number (there are plenty other types of SN available)
serial_number=$(sudo dmidecode -s system-serial-number)

# using dmidecode special keyword for processor version
processor=$(sudo dmidecode -s processor-version)

# using https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6481005/how-to-obtain-the-number-of-cpus-cores-in-linux-from-the-command-line
core_count=$(sudo dmidecode -t processor | awk -F': ' '/Core Count/ {print($2);}')

# using free to display the amount of free and use memory
# -g, --gibi - Display the amount of memory in gibibytes.
#
# the pipe into awk and search for any line starting with Mem and grab the 2nd column
ram_size=$(free -g | awk '/^Mem/ {print($2);}')

# To figure out the size of the physical harddrive we use lsblk
# "-I 8" only include entries of type 8 - which is the code for physical disks
# -d, --nodeps - Do not print holder devices or slaves.  For example, lsblk --nodeps /dev/sda prints information about the sda device only.
# -n, --noheadings - Do not print a header line.
#
# then pipe the result to awk, and print only the 4th column, which holds the disk size
hdd_size=$(lsblk -I 8 -dn | awk '{print($4);}')

# using linux built in flag for a rotational drive, we can figure out if we have a spining drive
# is SSD = 0 | HDD = 0
if [ $(cat /sys/block/sda/queue/rotational) -eq 0 ];
    then hdd_type="SSD";
    else hdd_type="HDD";
